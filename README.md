# React User Dashboard
This is a simple user dashboard application, allowing users to customize their experience and organize their data in a visually appealing manner. The dashboard can be used to display charts, graphs, and other visual aids, making it a great tool for data analysis. The switch between dark and light modes allows for easy customization and improved visibility of content. Currently it displays a set of empty panels. It requires a solid redesign.
